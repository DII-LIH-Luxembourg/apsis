# Biomarkers in Food Allergy Diagnosis (APSIS)

Food allergy is a global burden, affecting patients, society as a whole and the economy.
Clinical phenotypes of food-allergic patients are highly diverse. Differences in medical symptoms and clinical threshold levels suggest variable underlying endotypes.
In this study, we researched immune markers for the advanced stratification of peanut-allergic patients.
We analyzed deep immune phenotypes emerging during acute reactions by mass cytometry and computational analysis.
